#FXQuick

Simple program that pulls ForexFactory pending news reports and ranks them by impact along with giving a quick 
screenshot of what the USDJPY looks like.

Relies on OANDA for Prices!

Work in progress.

Final program will be a user input that shows input forex pair and news in one simple print out.

Still have to mesh code from my other program.
